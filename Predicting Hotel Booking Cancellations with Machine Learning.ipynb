    "# **Predictive Analysis of Hotel Booking Cancellations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "This study investigates hotel booking cancellations using machine learning techniques to identify the most effective predictive methods. The aim is to develop a model that accurately forecasts whether a booking will be cancelled based on crucial factors such as booking information, customer behaviour, and pricing details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Objectives**\n",
    "- To compare various predictive models, including **Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, Ridge, and Lasso Regression**.\n",
    "- To analyse how **feature selection and regularisation** influence the performance of these models.\n",
    "- To explore **threshold tuning** to reduce misclassification risks and effectively manage hotel overbooking.\n",
    "- To evaluate whether reducing the number of predictors enhances or diminishes model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methods**\n",
    "**Classification and regression methods** are employed, **cross-validation for model selection** is implemented, and **test errors and feature significance** are examined to inform our decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, the objective is to identify the most efficient strategy for predicting hotel cancellations. This will assist hotels in streamlining operations and minimising revenue losses from no-shows**."

    "### **Why Logistic Regression Performs Better**\n",
    "- **Linear Regression (OLS)** operates under the assumption that the target variable is continuous, which makes it **inappropriate for classification problems** where the outcome is binary (0 or 1).  \n",
    "- The **low MSE (0.1476) for Linear Regression does not equate to effective classification performance**, as MSE is not an optimal metric for categorical predictions.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression (Accuracy: 79.68%) is notably more efficient** in predicting cancellations because:\n",
    "  - It **estimates probabilities** instead of continuous outcomes.\n",
    "  - It **allocates probabilities to each class**, which enables threshold adjustments to reduce classification errors.\n",
    "  - The model **successfully differentiates between “cancelled” and “not cancelled” bookings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression is the favoured model for this task**, as it appropriately addresses binary classification.\n",
    "- **Linear Regression is not intended for categorical results**, and even though MSE may appear low, it does not accurately represent actual classification performance.\n",
    "- **Feature scaling considerably enhanced Logistic Regression’s accuracy**, ensuresimproved predictions.\n",

    "To predict cancellations, **Logistic Regression emerges as the superior model**, as it efficiently addresses binary classification and achieves a commendable accuracy of **79.68%**.

    "- The Logistic Regression increases when **feature scaling is applied effectively** (as performed during preprocessing).\n",
    "- While LDA and QDA offer **probabilistic classification**, Logistic Regression's optimization of the decision boundary via **maximum likelihood estimation** makes it **more suitable for binary classification tasks**, such as forecasting cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Effects of Threshold Adjustment in Logistic Regression**\n",
    "- Modifying the threshold in Logistic Regression created an opportunity to **manage false positives and negatives**, which is vital for reducing **overbooking risks**.\n",
    "Unlike Logistic Regression, LDA and QDA do not permit threshold modifications similarly, making them less adaptable to business requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression is the top-performing model overall (79.19%)**.\n",
    "- **LDA is a viable alternative (73.10%)** but lacks threshold tuning capabilities.\n",
    "- **QDA (72.59%) shows a higher tendency for overfitting**, indicating that assuming **a unified covariance structure (LDA) is preferable** for this dataset.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression with an adjusted threshold (e.g., 60%)** represents the optimal choice for the hotel seeking a balance between accuracy and clarity.\n",

    "1. **Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso Regression showed decreased performance following feature reduction**  \n",
    "   - **MSE rose notably** with fewer predictors (from **0.1476** to **0.2105**).  \n",
    "   - This indicates that **key features were excluded**, which compromised the model's accuracy.  \n",
    "   - **Regularization methods (Ridge & Lasso) did not significantly mitigate** the increase in errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression, LDA, and QDA also experienced a decline in accuracy**  \n",
    "   - Logistic Regression's accuracy **fell from 79.68% to 68.45%**.  \n",
    "   - LDA and QDA saw minor accuracy drops, suggesting that removing features impacted classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **QDA fared better with feature reduction compared to LDA and Logistic Regression**  \n",
    "   - QDA **maintained an accuracy of 68.37%**, indicating its adaptability to a reduced feature space.  \n",
    "   - This may be attributed to **its capacity to manage various covariance structures** effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Analysis of Findings**\n",
    "Reducing features hurt all models, which implies that the omitted variables contained significant information.\n",
    "The significant rise in MSE indicates that linear models (Ridge, Lasso, and Linear Regression) are susceptible to feature selection.\n",
    "- **Classification models (Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA) remained functional but at lower accuracy**, suggesting that some removed predictors were crucial for differentiating cancellations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Concluding Remarks**\n",
    "- **While reducing features can simplify models, it may also hinder accuracy.**\n",

    "Regularization methods (Ridge and Lasso) also experienced declines in performance, indicating that every predictor plays a valuable role.\n",

    "This project investigated various statistical and machine-learning techniques for forecasting hotel booking cancellations. Linear regression, Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, Ridge, and Lasso Regression were assessed, analyzing their effectiveness with **all predictors** and following **feature reduction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Main Discoveries**\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression emerged as the highest-performing classification model (79.68% accuracy).**  \n",
    "   - It successfully predicted cancellations and allowed for **threshold adjustments**, making it beneficial for business strategies.  \n",
    "   - Modifying the probability threshold assisted in balancing **false positives and false negatives**, mitigating overbooking risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LDA and QDA showed decent performances, but Logistic Regression surpassed them.**  \n",
    "   Assuming linear decision barriers, LDA achieved a reasonable outcome (**73.10% accuracy**).  \n",
    "   - QDA performed slightly worse (**72.59% accuracy**), indicating that a quadratic boundary did not significantly enhance results for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ridge and Lasso Regression offered insights but were less effective for classification.**  \n",
    "   - Ridge kept all the features intact with a **lower MSE (0.1475)**.  \n",
    "   - Lasso engaged in feature selection, narrowing the model down to **27 significant predictors**, though it produced a small increase in MSE (**0.1496**).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature reduction had a detrimental effect on all models.**  \n",
    "   - **Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso experienced notable MSE hikes**, suggesting that the omitted features held essential information.  \n",
    "   - **Classification models (Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA) recorded drops in accuracy**, highlighting the necessity of informed feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Suggestions**\n",
    "Logistic regression is the optimal choice for enhanced prediction accuracy, Logistic Regression stands out as the optimal choice**, particularly with threshold modifications to lessen overbooking risks.\n",
    "- **For clarity & feature selection:** **Lasso Regression aids in pinpointing crucial predictors**, making it advantageous for streamlining models while preserving performance.\n",
    "For stability in high-dimensional datasets, Ridge Regression is beneficial when multicollinearity poses a problem**, but it does not automatically select features.\n",
    "- **Feature selection should be informed by statistical methods (like Lasso) or business insight**, rather than arbitrary reductions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Insight**\n",
    "Utilizing Logistic Regression with adjusted thresholds, the hotel organization can effectively reduce the risk of overbooking while ensuring accurate cancellation predictions. Furthermore, Lasso Regression can facilitate feature selection** to uncover significant factors affecting cancellations, enabling better strategic choices.\n",
